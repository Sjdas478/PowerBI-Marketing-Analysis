# Campaign Analysis-Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
I built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to analyze the performance of digital ad campaigns across multiple platforms – **Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest**.

The goal was to:
- Identify which platform delivers the **best ROI and ROAS**.
- Understand how performance changes **month-over-month (MoM)**.
- Compare **location-level performance** to optimize targeting strategies.

## 📊 Analysis Highlights

### 1️⃣ Overall Campaign Performance
- Compared **Net Sales**, **Ad Spend**, and **Conversion Rate** across channels.
- Measured **% contribution** of each platform to total sales.
- Tracked engagement through **Likes, Shares, and Comments**.

**🔍 Insight:**  
Pintreat contributed **40.93% of total Net Sales**,  **highest Conversion Rate (37.30%)** and **lowest ad spend**, making it the most efficient channel.

### 2️⃣ Monthly Campaign Trends
- Month-on-Month (MoM) change in **Sales**, **ROAS**, and **Ad Spend**.
- Platform-level breakdown to spot growth trends or drop-offs.
- Interactive filters to select any month and explore patterns.

**🔍 Insight:**  
In **October**, Pinterest’s ROAS hit **22.87**, far outperforming other channels despite lower spend. Instagram showed consistent performance, while Facebook improved Net Sales with reduced ad costs.

### 3️⃣ Detailed City-Level Breakdown
- City & channel-wise performance tracking.
- KPIs monitored: **ROAS**, **Conversion %**, **Comments**, **Conversions**, and **Engagement**.
- Filters for **month** and **ad types** (e.g., Collection, Discount).

**🔍 Insight:**  
Pinterest dominated in **Bengaluru** and **Mumbai** with ROAS up to **44.04**.  
Facebook performed well in engagement in Bengaluru but showed lower ROI in Delhi and Mumbai.
